# Scaling Strategy

This document explains how to expand the Jenkins pipeline for enterprise-level automation.

## 1. Multi-Team Support
- Use Jenkins folders for separate teams/projects
- Each folder has dedicated pipelines (Build, Test, Deploy)

## 2. Agent Management
- Provision Docker agents dynamically
- Assign different agents per browser type
- Implement queue management to handle concurrency

## 3. Build Triggers
- Scheduled builds (cron)
- GitHub webhook triggers
- Manual parameterized triggers
- Upstream/downstream job dependencies

## 4. Reporting & Monitoring
- Use Build Monitor View and Dashboard View
- Archive artifacts for audit and analysis
- Email/slack notifications for build status

## 5. Future Expansion
- Add cloud agents for scalability
- Implement distributed test execution across multiple nodes
- Integrate performance metrics for capacity planning
